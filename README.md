# ðŸ“ˆECG-peak-detectionðŸ“‰
### This code takes sample ECG data and attempts to detect R Peaks. 
#### It does this with two different algorithims:
#### [Hamilton](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2532677/)
#### [Engelse and Zeelenberg](http://www.lx.it.pt/~afred/papers/Review%20and%20Comparison%20of%20Real%20Time%20Electrocardiogram%20Segmentation%20Algorithms%20for%20Biometric%20Applications.pdf)

### It also creates a result file with the relevant data, calculated bpm, and sensitivity compared to actual.
#### In addition it creates accompanying visualizations:
